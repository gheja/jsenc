		<h2>About jsenc</h2>
		
		<p>
			<strong>jsenc</strong> is mostly patches and extensions to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/">CryptoJS</a> and also some test scripts to provide demos for their usage. For more info please see the <a href="http://github.com/gheja/jsenc">GitHub repository</a> or the <a href="index.html">index page</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All the cryptographic work (password hashing, data encryption/decryption) is done <strong>in your browser, no data is ever transmitted to a server</strong>, all the encryption/decryption is happening in this window. This is the exact point of the library. After the page loads you can actually go offline and the page will still work.

		<h2>The examples</h2>
		
		<ul>
			<li><a href="jsenc01.html">jsenc01.html</a> Text encryption/decryption with a secure key derived from a password (PBKDF2, SHA256 + salt + iterations, AES + IV)</li>
			<li><a href="jsenc02.html">jsenc02.html</a> Text encryption/decryption with a Two Key Encryption (TKE) algorithm (altough I am not sure this is the proper name of it), it uses a secure key encrypted by one or more another key(s) derived from a password (PBKDF2, SHA256 + salt + iterations, AES + IV)</li>
		</ul>
